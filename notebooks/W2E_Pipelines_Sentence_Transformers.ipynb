        "As you probably know by now, BERT is a transformed-based, context-sensitive, neural language models that has been trained, among others, on a masked language modeling task, where the model learns to predict what the most likely word is at a a *masked* (hidden) position in the sentence. In a sentence like:\n",
        "\n",
        ">There were several [MASK] with the proposed solution.\n",
        "    \n",
        "the model will learn that the word *problems* or *issues* is more likely at this position than the word *unicorns* or *days*. The model uses both the right and left context of the masked position to make its predictions. Models trained to maximize the probability of predicting the correct masked words learn to represent a good amount of linguistic knowledge as a result of this.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **probe** is a test of a language model aimed at investigating how accurate these predictions are, especially for cases where syntax makes it quite clear that one (form of a) word is correct, and another word is impossible. In the example above, for instance, the masked position can be filled by a plural noun (*problems*) but not by a singular noun (*problem*). If the model makes predictions that respect the linguistic constraints, we have reason to believe that the model is somehow aware of the linguistic structure of the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "While predicting whether the masked position should be filled by a singular or plural noun seems easy in the example above (both *were* and *several* are good predictors of plural), we can try to make the task harder by looking for contexts where the solution requires more careful *attention* to the right words in the context\n",

        "Think of a grammatical phenomenon in a language of your choice, and come up with at least 5 example sentences to probe whether the model makes the correct predictions. Think of cases where the context makes it clear that the mask has to be plural or singular, that a verb has to have a particular form (like plural or singular, or participle or infinitive), that a specific (personal, possessive, reflexive) pronoun has to be used, that an adjective or noun has to have a specific inflection (like in German and more generally in languages with a rich case and/or gender marking system). There is a host of literature on this, see for instance [Marvin and Linzen](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09031) (for English) and [Sahin et al](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/coli_a_00376) (for multilingual probes).\n",

This means that you do not have to choose examples from English, but that you may also present a probe for another language.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following loads the pipeline for doing masked prediction, and load the mBERT model (this may take a minute or so). You can ignore the warning about some weights not being initialized. The pipeline can be used to test masked language model prediction. Given a sequence containing the special token [MASK], the model will predict what the most likely tokens are at that position, using both left and right context."
